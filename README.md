This is a very basic and sample project for our (learners) to create a web page. 
While doing so, I have used some skills i have learnt yet, as below:
    - creating a home page (index.html)
    - giving links to other pages
    - adding images into a web page
    - using unordered/ordered lists
In the scope of this project, we have been required to write two-three recipes so that i chose two delicious turkish anatolian recipes: karniyarik and tomato soup.
